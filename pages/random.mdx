If in terminal I type:
 ```cd``` it goes to a folder up
 ```ls``` it shows everything in the folder
 ```cd``` then I type the 3 first words of the folder then press TAB it will auto complete, if press ENTER then I will enter in the folder
 ```mv``` means move so if I type ```mv documentation-starter-kit ../``` it means move this folder for a folder up
 ```code -r .``` it opens the folder on CODE otherwise I can do to file and open.
